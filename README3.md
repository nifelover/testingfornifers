<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>

  <title> this is where you put the title of the webpage </title>

</head>

<body>

<p> In html, you put everything in between starting and ending brackets with matching text/codewords. The only difference is that the ending bracket will have a slash before the text. Using a lowercase "p" will print small text like this. </p>

<h2> using an h and a number after it from 1=6 makes headings! the higher the number, the smaller the heading is. </h2>

<h5> hi i am small </h5>

<h1> i am big chungus big bgi chungus </h1>

<p> you can also see BIG sections in the code that say "head" and "body". The body handles all the code of the webpage itself, and the head deals with what's up on the tab of the website. </p>
